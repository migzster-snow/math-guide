A comprehensive collection of mathematical notes and explanations, neatly typeset in **LaTeX**. This guide covers a wide range of mathematical topics with theory, worked examples, and formulas all in one place.  

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- **Discrete Mathematics** — logic, sets, combinatorics, graph theory  
- **Calculus** — limits, derivatives, integrals, series  
- **Linear Algebra** — vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, transformations  
- **Multivariate Calculus** — partial derivatives, multiple integrals, vector calculus  
- **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** — first/second-order, systems, applications  
- **Statistics & Probability** — distributions, hypothesis testing, regression  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide a **single, structured LaTeX guide** for essential mathematics.  
- Combine **theory and worked examples** for clarity and practice.  
- Serve as both a **learning resource** and a **quick reference**.
